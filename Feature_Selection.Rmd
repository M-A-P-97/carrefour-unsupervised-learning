## Research Question

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into three parts where you'll explore a recent marketing data set by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.



## Import the dataset

```R
df <- read.csv('Supermarket_Dataset_1_part_1_2 - Sales Data.csv')

# Top 6 observations
head(df)

# Getting the column names
colnames(df)

# Getting the dimension of the dataset
dim(df)

# Getting the structure of the dataset
str(df)

# Identifying missing data in the dataset
is.na(df)

# Finding total missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(df))

# Dealing with the missing values
df <- na.omit(df)

```

```R
# Detecting and Handling Outliers
boxplot.stats(df$Tax)$out
boxplot.stats(df$Tax)

# Previewing Datasets
View(df)
str(df)
dim(df)
class(df)

# Detecting and Handling Duplicates
duplicated(df)

# Look for any duplicates in the dataset
anyDuplicated(df)

# Finding Duplicated rows
duplicated_rows <- df[duplicated(df), ]

# Removing Duplicated rows
df <- unique(df)
```

```R
# Measures of Central Tendency
# Using the Tax observation columns

# Mean
mean(df$Tax)

# Median
median(df$Tax)

# Mode
getMode <- function(v){
uniqv <- unique(v)
uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
getMode(df$Tax)

# Install skimr package
# install.packages('skimr')
library(skimr)
skim(df)

```
## Including Plots

```R
# Including the plots

# Histogram of Quantity
hist(df$Quantity, main = 'Histogram of Quantity', xlab = "Quantity")

# Histogram of Tax
hist(df$Tax, main = 'Histogram of Tax', xlab = "Tax")

# Boxplot of Tax to check for outlier
boxplot(df$Tax)

```

## Bivariate and Multivariate EDA
```R
# Correlation between Gross Income and Quantity sold
df_gross <- df$gross.income

cor(df$Tax, df_gross)

# Covariance between Gross Income and Quantity sold

cov(df$Tax, df_gross)

# creating a scatter plot

plot(df$Tax, df_gross, xlab="Tax", ylab="Gross Income")

```

## Feature Selection
```R
# Using Embedded Methods
# ---
# We will use the ewkm function from the wskm package.
# This is a weighted subspace clustering algorithm that is well suited to very high dimensional data.
# ---


# We install and load our wskm package
# ---
#
suppressWarnings(
        suppressMessages(if
                         (!require(wskm, quietly=TRUE))
                install.packages("wskm")))
library(wskm)

set.seed(2)
model <- ewkm(df[12:15], 3, lambda=2, maxiter=1000)

```

```R
# Loading and installing our cluster package
# ---
#
suppressWarnings(
        suppressMessages(if
                         (!require(cluster, quietly=TRUE))
                install.packages("cluster")))
library("cluster")

# Cluster Plot against 1st 2 principal components
# ---
#
clusplot(df[12:15], model$cluster, color=TRUE, shade=TRUE,
         labels=2, lines=1,main='Cluster Analysis for CarreFour')

```
```R
# Weights are calculated for each variable and cluster. 
# They are a measure of the relative importance of each variable 
# with regards to the membership of the observations to that cluster. 
# The weights are incorporated into the distance function, 
# typically reducing the distance for more important variables.
# Weights remain stored in the model and we can check them as follows:
# 
round(model$weights*100,2)

```
