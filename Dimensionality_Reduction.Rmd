## Research Question

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into three parts where you'll explore a recent marketing data set by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.



## Import the dataset

```R
df <- read.csv('Supermarket_Dataset_1_part_1_2 - Sales Data.csv')

# Top 6 observations
head(df)

# Getting the column names
colnames(df)

# Getting the dimension of the dataset
dim(df)

# Getting the structure of the dataset
str(df)

# Identifying missing data in the dataset
is.na(df)

# Finding total missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(df))

# Dealing with the missing values
df <- na.omit(df)

```

```R
# Detecting and Handling Outliers
boxplot.out(df$Tax)$out
boxplot.out(df$Tax)

# Previewing Datasets
View(df)
str(df)
dim(df)
class(df)

# Detecting and Handling Duplicates
duplicated(df)

# Look for any duplicates in the dataset
anyDuplicated(df)

# Finding Duplicated rows
duplicated_rows <- df[duplicated(df), ]

# Removing Duplicated rows
df <- unique(df)
```

```R
# Measures of Central Tendency
# Using the Tax observation columns

# Mean
mean(df$Tax)

# Median
median(df$Tax)

# Mode
getMode <- function(v){
uniqv <- unique(v)
uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
getMode(df$Tax)

# Install skimr package
install.packages('skimr')
library(skimr)
skim(df)

```
## Including Plots

```R
# Including the plots

# Histogram of Quantity
hist(df$Quantity, main = 'Histogram of Quantity', xlab = "Quantity")

# Histogram of Tax
hist(df$Tax, main = 'Histogram of Tax', xlab = "Tax")

# Boxplot of Tax to check for outlier
boxplot(df$Tax)

```

## Bivariate and Multivariate EDA
```R
# Correlation between Gross Income and Quantity sold
df_gross <- df$gross.income

cor(df$Tax, df_gross)

# Covariance between Gross Income and Quantity sold

cov(df$Tax, df_gross)

# creating a scatter plot

plot(df$Tax, df_gross, xlab="Tax", ylab="Gross Income")

```

## Dimensionality Reduction - Principal Component Analysis
```R
# Principal Component Analysis

# Select all the numerical data
df_pca <- prcomp(df[,c(12:15)], center = TRUE)

# Check the structure of the PCA object
str(df_pca)

# Plot the PCA 
# Use ggbiplot visualisation
library(devtools)
install_github("vqv/ggbiplot")

# Load the ggbiplot
library(ggbiplot)
ggbiplot(df_pca)

# Plotting PCA 3 & PCA 4
ggbiplot(df_pca, ellipse = TRUE, choices = c(1,2), 
labels = rownames(df), groups = df$Branch)

```
